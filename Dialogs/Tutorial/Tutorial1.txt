Ah...\nAnother lost soul,\nwandering green silence.
You’re not from\nhere, are you?
Eyes wide,\nuncertain, like hatchlings.
Hah... The forest\nhas a sense\nof humor.
It listens, breathes,\nchanges when unseen.
I’ve walked long\nalone—until now.
Paths twist, truths\nhide beneath leaves.
Something’s wrong...\ndeep in roots.
Still, it brought\nyou here. Curious,\nhopeful. 
Unready,\nbut not unwelcome.
Stick close, little\none.
I remember\nold signs, places\nwhere light lingers.\n
Step careful.
The\nforest forgives only\nwhat it understands.\n
Let’s begin, shall\nwe?
