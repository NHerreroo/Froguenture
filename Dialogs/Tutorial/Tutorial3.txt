Ah... even the forest's floor\nhas teeth here.
Spikes, silent and sharp.\nThey wait for careless steps.
But you are not helpless.
There is a way to pass.
Use your dash—press the\nspacebar to surge forward.
If you time it right,\nyou won’t feel the pain.
Dash while crossing the spikes.\nSwift motion avoids sharp lessons.
