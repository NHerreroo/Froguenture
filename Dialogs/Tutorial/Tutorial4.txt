Oh... a customer?
My whiskers tingle—it's been\nages since someone wandered\ninto my... domain.
You're in luck, little root-walker.
The spirits whispered of your arrival.
Or maybe it was just indigestion.
These envelopes?\nThey contain magical cards\n of forgotten power.
Each one holds a force,\na twist, a blessing... or a bite.
There are cards of all types,\nand in all colors.
Each color hums with\na different kind of strength.
But I won’t spoil the mystery.
This one is free.\nNo coins, no curses.\nJust this once.
But don’t let generosity fool you.\nThe forest doesn’t make a habit\nof being kind.
Next time,\nyou’ll have to trade.\nAnd who knows—maybe I’m not\nthe only merchant among the trees...
