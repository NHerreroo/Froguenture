So... you made it.
That’s good.
They were faster than I remembered.\nHungrier too...
I won’t be going any further.\nNot for now.
Here—take this.\nMy map.
It’s old, but it still remembers\npaths better than I do right now.
Use it to reach the edge.\nThe forest opens if you insist\nenough.
I need to rest.\nThese old bones weren’t built\nfor slime ambushes.
But don’t worry.\nI’ve survived worse.
Give me a moment...\nor a hundred.
Go on.
I'll find you again,\nwhen my shell stops spinning.
