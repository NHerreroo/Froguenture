...Ah. Another soul, drifting\nthrough the green veil.
You're not from here, are you?
I can see it in your eyes—wide,\nuncertain.
Like a hatchling fresh\nfrom its shell.
Strange... I’ve walked for years\nwithout meeting another.
And now,you appear.
Hah. The forest has\n its own sense of humor.
This place... it’s alive in ways\nmost wouldn’t understand.
The trees listen. 
The stones whisper\n when the moon is high.
And the paths?\nThey change \nwhen you're not looking.
Once, long ago, this forest\nthrummed with harmony.
ow, it’s...quieter.\n Heavier.\n Something’s gone wrong\nat the roots.
But you're not here for tales,\nare you? 
You're here because\nthe forest wants you here.
It pulls in the lost,\n the forgotten,\nthe hopeful...
You don’t even know how to\nmove through it yet.
That look—\nyou’ve never tracked moss with\nyour eyes... 
never felt the ground\nbreathe beneath your feet.
Lucky for you, I still remember\na few things.
Old paths.\nHidden signs. The places where\nthe light still touches\nthe leaves.
Stay near me, little one. I’ll\nhelp you find a way forward...\nat least, as far as the\nforest allows.
But remember this—out here,\nknowing where to step is just\nas important as knowing when\nnot to.
Now come. Let’s see if the\nforest is in a forgiving mood\ntoday.
